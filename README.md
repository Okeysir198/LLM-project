## Problem Statement

Design and implement a Q&A system to assist field engineers in the refrigeration domain. The system should facilitate the diagnosis of faulty equipment by utilizing installation and maintenance manuals.

## Solution Overview

This project implements a chatbot system utilizing LangChain and Streamlit. The system comprises the following key components:

* **Frontend:** A web-based application developed using Streamlit that provides the user interface for interacting with the chatbot.
* **Backend:** Powered by LangChain, the backend leverages large language model (LLM) tools for storing data, processing user input, and generating relevant responses.
